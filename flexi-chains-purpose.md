<h1>Why is flexi-chains needed?</h1>

The Snowden leaks enlightened the world to what many had long suspected. The existence of hostile Global Passive Adversaries - and worse, active attacks upon every individual in the world - not least by their own governments.  

TOR has many flaws. In an ideal world, we'd fix those flaws. flexi-chains intends to be not only a stop-gap measure, but to allow you to retake control - without waiting 5 years and creating a new cryptocoin. Flexi-chains enables you to choose the protocols, timing, and [operating systems](https://qubes-os.org) that best suit your needs.  

<h2>Aren't there existing solutions?</h2>

**Yes. (And no).**  
There are no existing open-source solutions.  
Currently your best option, IMHO, is to manually chain Qubes VMs with different protocols - but this is very time consuming and non-trivial for most users.

**You mentioned TOR?**  
[This recent article](https://www.bitdefender.com/blog/hotforsecurity/threat-actor-compromised-more-than-25-percent-of-tor-network-relays-research-shows) is one of an abundance of evidence as to why just using TOR is no longer reasonably secure.  
**What about [nym](https://nymtech.net/)?**  
Just using Nym has the same foundational issues that TOR does.

**How is flexi-chains any different, in principle, from anything else?**  
I still want there to be an open-source Not Uniquely Identifiable network for everyone to use. 
However, to have a truly NUI network (refering solely to the network layer), you NEED the option for private and anonymised, (via steganography), nodes.  
In short, a truly NUI-network would be an advanced proxychains. In this sense, you can think of flexi-chains as a gateway to NUI-net - it is just a really really advanced proxy-chains.
