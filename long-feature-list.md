<h2>V.long feature list</h2>

**fc-core-protocol**  
Why: needed to function  

**net-protocol support via glider**  
Why: needed to have multi-protocol support (without months of work)

**Bash-app**  
Why:  easy configurability via terminal.  

**barebones-gui**  
Why:  get users on-board for beta  

**simple-gui**  
Why:  easy-to-use for v0

**net-protocol support via APIs**  
Why: improve speed, stability and remove dependency on external projects with restrictive licences

**plugins-API**  
Why: this is a pivotal step to something approaching true anonymity. (e.g: super cool browser plugins :P)  

**OS-layer-API**  
Why: so we can rinse the $ from SecureView (jks, it's so to reduce dependency on a single 'OS-layer' - but this is EFITF rc).
