<h1>How it works - General Overview</h1>

<h2>Introduction - Key Concepts</h2>

Flexi-Chains enables you to create **chain**s.  
Each chain is composed of **link**s.  
Links are chronologically numbered integers i.e:  
link 1, link 2, link 3, etc...  

A link can be a **guard** or a **tunnel**.  
A guard is intended to act as a dedicated guard - (e.g. firewall, IPS/IDS).  
A tunnel is intended to tunnel/forward your traffic.  
Althought there is much overlap, to simplify things - you should think of **guard**s and **tunnel**s as entirely different from one-another.  

<h2>**Guard**s</h2>


<h2>**Tunnel**s</h2>

FLexi-chains enables you to chain together an unlimited^ number of links - of guards and/or tunnels. 
Flexi-chains enables you to chain together any^^ tunnel protocol (openvpn, socks proxy, TOR, etc), in any order^^.  



^:  
Limited only by your system resources, and practical latency/bandwidth constraints.  
^^:  
Subject to availability & compatability
