<h1>How it works - General Overview</h1>

<h2>Introduction - Key Concepts</h2>

Flexi-Chains enables you to create '**chains**'.  
Each chain is composed of '**links**'.  
Links are chronologically numbered integers i.e:  
link 1, link 2, link 3, etc...  

A link can be a '**guard**' or a '**tunnel**'. 
A guard is intended as a dedicated firewall.  
A tunnel is intended to tunnel/forward your traffic.  





FLexi-chains enables you to chain together an unlimited^ number of links - of guards and/or tunnels. 
Flexi-chains enables you to chain together any^^ tunnel protocol (openvpn, socks proxy, TOR, etc), in any order^^.  



^:  
Limited only by your system resources, and practical latency/bandwidth constraints.  
^^:  
Subject to availability & compatability
